## Sentiment Classification

## Overview

In this section, it was designed to implement and evaluate a sentiment classifier with working with the Financial Phrasebank dataset [1] which contained English news articles from financial articles on the Helsinki stock exchange. Each sentence is labelled with different three labels which are neutral (0), negative (1) or positive (2). 

For this task, it applied the text normalization methods, namely tokenization, lemmatization and lemmatization & bi-grams that transform the raw text to an input format.
