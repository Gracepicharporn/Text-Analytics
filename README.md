# Text-Analytics
This repository contains the natural language processing (NLP) project, namely, sentiment classification, named entity recognition, Word Embeddings, Neural Text Classifiers and Transformers. More information can be found in the folders as below:

---   
  
## Sentiment-NER

This folder combines the sentiment classification and named entity recognition with [the Financial Phrasebank dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/financial_phrasebank) [1] and [the SEC-Filings dataset](https://www.sec.gov/dera/data/financial-statement-data-sets.html) dataset [2].

---   

## Embeddings-Neural_Text

The task for word embeddings and neural text classifiers are provided in this folder. This worked with the [the tweet eval sentiment](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tweet_eval) dataset [3].

--- 

## Tranfomers

Contextualised embeddings from pretrained transformer models and Classification with transformers working with [the Tweet Eval dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tweet_eval) [4] are included in this folder
